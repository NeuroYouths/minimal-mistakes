# Brain Science for Healthy Communities
The NeuroYouths Project ([Award # NIJ 2016-R2-CX-0019](https://www.nij.gov/funding/awards/pages/award-detail.aspx?award=2016-R2-CX-0019)) is a National Institute of Justice (NIJ)-funded community-engaged dissertation research study on neighborhood health, violence and youth brain development.

## The Teen Brain in Flux
The years following puberty are incredibly important for the formation of personal identity, building meaningful interpersonal relations, figuring out what we really think about our role in society/the larger universe and deciding "*what we want to be when we grow up.*"

This period is an opportunity to take risks, make mistakes and refine goals to better suit our own strengths and weaknesses. The drive of future community leaders, the ambition of young entrepreneurs and the curiosity of nascent scholars all begins to take form during these years, often by trial-and-error.

The transformative potential of adolescence is dependent on precisely timed biochemical events that occur throughout the body but most importantly in the brain. Rapidly changing hormones can modulate aggression, self-confidence and reward-seeking while the brain's ability to inhibit immediate emotional responses and pleasure-seeking is still not fully developed.

## How can we tell if someone is grown-up anyway?
Measuring maturity is one of central aims of the NeuroYouths Study Team. Maturity can be considered as a life-long process that begins once we master basic cognitive skills (i.e., language, reasoning, social skills) in early childhood and continues as we absorb lessons from observing both our own and others' failures and successes.

The ability to learn from example is a type of learning called **reinforcement learning**. If you have a hamster or cat, you may already know that rewarded behaviors are reinforced while punished behaviors are readjusted. This same rule applies to all intelligent animals (including humans)!

A young person is thought to achieve greater levels of maturity when they begin to make complex associations between abstract rewards and behaviors serving complex socially-aware goals that reflect deep introspection and self-understanding.

The level of maturity of a person can be estimated based on whether that person can articulate:

1. A sophisticated goal based on personal needs and social opportunities
2. An understanding of one's own strengths and weaknesses
3. A well thought-out plan to begin overcoming barriers to achieve that goal

The ability to articulate goals, construct plans and learn from mistakes is heavily dependent on having positive examples, a social support network and an environment enriched with opportunities. 

We study the reward system in the brain in order to understand the biological process for how young people mature from puberty to young adulthood in both the presence and absence of social support, community violence and economic opportunity.

# The Brain's Reward System
Rewards can take many different forms such as sugar, money or social recognition. The experience of satisfaction when a reward is achieved is thought to be related to the release of a chemical in the brain called dopamine.

Dopamine is a small chemical manufactured and distributed by cells called neurons that are located deep at the base of the brain near the brainstem. 

{% include gallery id="trs" caption="The Ventral Tegmentum Area (VTA) and Substantia Nigra *pars compacta* (SNc) are structures nested deep within the brainstem and manufacture most of the dopamine needed by the brain. These structures send dopamine signals all throughout the brain, specifically to the **striatum**, a region important for associating reward with behavior." class="align-center" %}

Many drugs of abuse that cause euphoric feelings of intense pleasure and joy (methamphetamines, MDMA, cocaine, crack, heroin, opium) act on nerve cells that respond to dopamine. 

These are considered drugs of *abuse* because repeated use leads to decreased dopamine release. This can cause a diminished high, decreased drive for life goals and very serious health effects leading to death over time. 

## Habits & Reward Seeking are Controlled by the Striatum & Prefrontal Cortex
The learning of behavior patterns and habits that lead to rewards is thought to occur in a brain structure called the **striatum**. 

The striatum utilizes dopamine to activate neural patterns stored in prefrontal cortex required for the planning and execution of behavior and movement.

{% include gallery id="dsm" caption="The prefrontal cortex and striatum continue to develop during the teenage years by supporting the formation of goals and the transition of rewarded behavior patterns into habits. The striatum has three major divisions, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the caudate and the putamen." class="align-center" %}

### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reveals Brain Activity
Neuroscience research using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a technique that measures blood oxygenation to estimate brain activity, has shown evidence that reinforcement learning skills rapidly develop after puberty starts. 

See the video below to visualize what brain activity measured with fMRI looks like in the average individual at rest.

fMRI of teenagers shows that activity in the striatum increases after puberty and all-throughout adolescence until the middle of young-adulthood, supporting the idea of continued brain maturation during and beyond the teenage years.

Psychological testing has suggested teenagers take bigger risks and make more impulsive decisions compared to adults in laboratory gambling games. Brain imaging research of developing teenagers has confirmed that the brain's reward system is more active in teenagers compared to adults and may potentially override prefrontal cortical control of impulsive behavior.

# Community Health & Youth Brain Development
These early behavioral and brain imaging studies examine risk taking behavior in the singular context of a laboratory gambling task and do not explain real world behavior. The jury is still out on how the reward system predicts youth risk-taking in the world outside of the lab. 

Our project aims to provide new insight by collecting additional data on family cohesion, social adversity and community violence. We are focusing our efforts on understanding how the prefrontal cortex communicates with the different regions of the striatum.

## Families with Teens Aged 12-18 are Invited to Participate in our Study
We are seeking families in the Washington, D.C metro area from communities challenged with violence to participate in our study.

The study involves:
- Two visits (2 hours each) to Georgetown within the span of a year
- Interviews about violence in the neighborhood
- Games that measure emotional responses
- Non-invasive (safe) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for taking a picture of the teen's brain

Teen Participants are paid up to $40 per visit for a total of $80 for two visits. Parents/Guardians are paid up to $25 per visit for a total of $50 for two visits.
