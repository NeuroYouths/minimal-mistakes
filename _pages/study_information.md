### The study involves:
- Two visits (2 hours each) to the Georgetown University Medical Center within the span of a year
- Interviews about violence in the neighborhood
- Games that measure emotional responses
- Non-invasive (safe) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for taking a picture of the teen's brain

### Incentives for Participation
Teen Participants are paid up to $40 per visit for a total of $80 for two visits. 

Parents/Guardians are paid up to $25 per visit for a total of $50 for two visits.
