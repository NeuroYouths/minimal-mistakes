The NeuroYouths Study is a 3-year dissertation research project funded by the Department of Justice, through the Office of Justice Programs in the National Institute of Justice (Award # NIJ 2016-R2-CX-0019) awarded to Ph.D Candidate Shady El Damaty to illustrate how brain activity and structure changes in response to violence in the community.

All study activities take place at the Center for Functional & Molecular Imaging (CFMI) at the Georgetown University Medical Center. We perform guided interviews, cognitive testing and image brain activity and structure using a Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla Scanner. Our scanning facility will soon be upgraded to the PRISMA system in the summer of 2018 made possible by a [$5 million grant from the National Institute of Health](LINKTOGRANT).

The study team is advised by Drs. Diana H. Fishbein and John W. VanMeter.
