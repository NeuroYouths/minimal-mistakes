## Disparities in Social Support for Youth Development 

Healthy communities can nurture the future potential of their youth by providing a social support network that is safe and generates opportunities for young people to cultivate intrinsic talents. Unfortunately, not all youths have the same opportunities to explore, err and learn (read more about the [school-to-prison pipeline](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-the-school-to-prison-pipeline-works)).

## Juvenile Justice Sentencing: Corrections or Punishment?
For some youth, a single mistake can cause drastic, long-lasting consequences. Teenagers caught on the wrong side of the law will find themselves facing sentencing at the same level as an adult. As far as the law is concerned, punishment must be consistent to maintain the legitimacy of the judicial system. 

While this may deter mature adults from committing crimes, there is very little provision for young men and women that have not yet reached maturity.
Young men and women that could benefit from targeted counseling or enrichment are instead shipped into [overcrowded detention facilities that are often privately run and provide little-to-no oversight](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/prisoners-of-profit).

Detention centers expose young occupants to confined spaces, low-quality educational & counseling resources, the threat of violence and degraded social interactions that are known to cause [irreversible emotional, mental and physical trauma](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/11/from-solitary-to-the-street?ref=collections). 

Exposure to traumatic environments during adolescence, such as juvenile detention centers, is suspected to enforce the very patterns of antisocial behavior and attitudes that lead to a cycle of re-offending and a lifetime spent in the criminal justice system.  

Converging research studies have demonstrated that punishment is, by far, the *least* effective form of crime prevention. The most successful intervention techniques involve addressing the underlying causes of social adversity by equipping youth with practical life skills for problem solving and economic contribution.

### Practical Interventions Reduce Crime, *Not Punishment*
